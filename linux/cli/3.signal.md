### Signals
- A signal is a message that is sent to a process to notify it that a particular event has occurred.
- Signals are used to handle asynchronous events, such as:
  - User interrupts (e.g., `Ctrl + C`)
  - Termination requests
  - Hardware exceptions
  - Software errors
  - Other events

### Signal Types
- There are many different types of signals, each with its own unique number and name.

### Most Common Signals
The following signals are the most commonly used signals:
- SIGINT (2) - Interrupt (e.g., `Ctrl + C`)
- SIGKILL (9) - Kill (unblockable) (e.g., `kill -9`)
- SIGTERM (15) - Termination (e.g., `kill`)
- SIGQUIT (3) - Quit (e.g., `Ctrl + D`)
