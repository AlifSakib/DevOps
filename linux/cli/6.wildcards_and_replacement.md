### Wildcards and Replacement

A brief aside here for how to select multiple files.

- `*` - matches any number of characters
  - `ls *.txt` - list all files with a `.txt` extension
  - `rm *.txt` - remove all files with a `.txt` extension
  - `cp *.txt /path/to/directory` - copy all files with a `.txt` extension to a directory
  - `mv *.txt /path/to/directory` - move all files with a `.txt` extension to a directory

- `?` - matches a single character
- `[]` - matches a single character within the specified range
- `[^]` - matches a single character not within the specified range
- `{}` - matches a group of patterns
  - `ls {file1,file2}.txt` - list files `file1.txt` and `file2.txt`
  - `rm {file1,file2}.txt` - remove files `file1.txt` and `file2.txt`
  - `cp {file1,file2}.txt /path/to/directory` - copy files `file1.txt` and `file2.txt` to a directory
  - `mv {file1,file2}.txt /path/to/directory` - move files `file1.txt` and `file2.txt` to a directory


Example:
```
touch file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt file4.txt file5.txt
ls *.txt
rm *.txt
```

### Expensions
Let's say you wanted to create three files using touch all at once. You could do:
```
touch file{1,2,3}.txt
```
This would create `file1.txt`, `file2.txt`, and `file3.txt`.

Pretty cool right? Okay, let's get a couple more advance ones in there. We'll use echo from now one to not fill up our folder with garbage files but know this works anywhere in bash.

```
echo {a..z} # prints a to z
echo {A..Z} # prints A to Z
echo {1..10} # prints 1 to 10
echo {1..10..2} # prints 1 3 5 7 9
```
