#### Repeat the Last Command
- Press `!!` to repeat the last command.

#### Repeat the Last Argument
- Press `Alt + .` to repeat the last argument of the previous command.

#### Run a Command in the Background
- Add `&` at the end of the command to run it in the background.

#### Run a Command in the Foreground
- Press `Ctrl + Z` to pause the command and then run `fg` to resume it in the foreground.

#### Redirect Output to a File
- Use `>` to redirect the output of a command to a file. For example, `ls > files.txt` will save the output of `ls` to a file called `files.txt`.

#### Append Output to a File
- Use `>>` to append the output of a command to a file. For example, `ls >> files.txt` will append the output of `ls` to a file called `files.txt`.

#### Pipe Output to Another Command
- Use `|` to pipe the output of one command to another command. For example, `ls | grep .txt` will list all files in the current directory and then filter the results to only show files with a `.txt` extension.

#### Run a Command as Another User
- Use `sudo` to run a command as another user. For example, `sudo apt-get update` will run the `apt-get update` command as the root user.
