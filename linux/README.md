### What is Linux ?
- Linux is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on *September 17, 1991*, by **Linus Torvalds**. Linux is typically packaged in a Linux distribution.


### Unix
Linux is considered a Unix-like operating system which basically means that Linux derives heavy inspiration from Unix without actually conforming to be a full Unix operating system. macOS and FreeBSD would be two more examples of a Unix-like operating system.



Unix was created in the 70s at **Bell Labs (from which descended AT&T)** and has pretty much inspired every operating system created since then. Nearly everything you're going to learn today was originated in Unix itself. A big part of Unix software is the idea of the [*"Unix philosophy"*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) which is a sort of digital minimalism when it comes to coding. The idea is instead of having a few very specialized tools (or programs) we should have many small, composable tools that we can use to compose to solve larger problems. The influence of this is still felt and talked about today. Hopefully today you'll learn many of these principles. Here's what they originally wrote:

- Make each program do one thing well. To do a new job, build afresh rather than complicate old programs by adding new "features".
- Expect the output of every program to become the input to another, as yet unknown, program. Don't clutter output with extraneous information. Avoid stringently columnar or binary input formats. Don't insist on interactive input.
- Design and build software, even operating systems, to be tried early, ideally within weeks. Don't hesitate to throw away the clumsy parts and rebuild them.
- Use tools in preference to unskilled help to lighten a programming task, even if you have to detour to build the tools and expect to throw some of them out after you've finished using them.


I still think there's a lot of wisdom here and it's something I try to incorporate into my coding. I hope you will too.

Tip: If you're interested in learning more about the history of Unix, I'd recommend reading the book [*"The Unix Programming Environment"*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unix_Programming_Environment) by Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike. It's a great book and it's a quick read. It's also a great way to learn about the Unix philosophy and how it's still relevant today.
